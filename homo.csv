1,1,What type of distribution does a single interarrival time follow?,exponential,gamma,beta,poisson,exponential,Check the interarrival time distribution plot.
2,2,"For the homogeneous Poisson Process below, which lambda best fits the plot?",2,3,4,5,4,Incorrect. What is the relationship between N(t) and the time?
3,3,What type of the intensity functions best fits the plot?,constant,inverse,exponential,linear,constant,Incorrect. Pay attention to the shape of the curve.
4,4,What type of the intensity functions best fits the plot?,constant,inverse,exponential,linear,inverse,Incorrect. Pay attention to the shape of the curve.
5,5,What type of the intensity functions best fits the plot?,constant,inverse,exponential,linear,exponential,Incorrect. Pay attention to the shape of the curve.
6,6,What type of the intensity functions best fits the plot?,constant,inverse,exponential,linear,linear,Incorrect. Pay attention to the shape of the curve.
7,7,"For the homogeneous Poisson Process below, which lambda best fits the plot?",3,0.3,0.2,2,0.3,Incorrect. What is the relationship between N(t) and the time?
8,8,"Supposed that the number of events is fixed. For the homogeneous Poisson Process, if lambda is large, then what should the time be?",large,small,the same,undecided,small,Move the bar of the plot and see the changes for the time.
9,9,"Supposed the time is fixed. For the homogeneous Poisson Process, when the total number of events increase, how would lambda change",larger,smaller,the same,undecided,larger,Move the bar of the plot and see the changes for lambda.
10,10,"For a homogeneous poisson process, is lambda a function of time?",Yes,No,undecided,I don't know.,No,This is a homogeneous process. Look at the prerequisite for both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous poisson process.
